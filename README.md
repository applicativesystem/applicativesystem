**About me**

I have a background in plant biology/bioinformatics. I have developed the skills, I would need as a scientist/academician/researcher/specialist. I consider myself to be someone with a high level of perseverance who is driven and eager to learn and apply what i have learnt. I am result oriented, directive and featured person, who endures developing the capabilities and continous development. Till now, i havent use AI for code writing. **I'm based in Germany/Deutschland.** You can contact me at **[Gmail](mailto:gauravcodepro@gmail.com)/[AppleMail](mailto:codeprog@icloud.com)** I'm open to Scientist/Academics/Researcher/Developer. [**Curriculum Vitae/Past Employers References**](https://github.com/codecreatede/codecreatede/blob/main/Curriculum_Vitae_Gaurav_Sablok_2024.pdf), [**Scopus**](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36633064300), [**ORCID**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4157-9405), [**Web of Science**](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/C-5940-2014). 

**Getting to Know me ahead**
- You can read this to understand how to avoid fake and how to invest in real people [**Getting to know ahead**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pOfBWigcJAuQitLSdpxnD1YZ3hB6ZkU0/view?usp=sharing)
- Deciding my personal preferences/choices/likes/dislikes is not anyone role and neither i will consider nor i will give importance. 
- No one has the right to make a decision for any other indivual based on their thinking/assumptions.
- Extremely collaborative and I only supports those who support me and take right approaches. 
- Highly Communicative, approachable, motivated, task and solution oriented, time responsive, and initiative taker.
- If you havent heard or confirmed with me and believed anything, you have heard from wrong/false/fake people.

**Scientific/Academic/Research:Plant, Bacterial, Fungal Bioinformatics, Deep Learning,and DevOPs.**
- **2024 onwards:** Universitat Potsdam, Germany, where I am currently based and self-learnt Julia, GO and Javascript. I benchmarked PacBioHifi genome analysis with complete web-based real time monitoring invoking javascript/HTML-CSS, and coded several packages, gems in Python, Ruby, Julia, GO. Self-learning Geospatial Application Development in Python and Javascript.
- **2022-2023:** I added several new skills as a carrier advancement and added machine and deep learning, added certification on devops and self-learnt Python, Web and Application development. 
- **2020-2021:** Finnish Museum of Natural History and the University of Helsinki, Finland. I managed the sequencing used the NextSeq methods, including sequencing library methods. I completed genome assembly, annotations, markers genes, ITS, and phylogenomics of over 500 different species.
- **2017-2021:** Finnish Museum of Natural History and University of Helsinki, Finland conducting research on genome bioinformatics and sequencing the genomes of lower plants, including *Coleochaete orbicularis*, *Blasia pusilla*, *Chaetospiridium orbicularis*, *Polytrichum commune*, *Mallomonas*, and *Cryptomonas* species, in which I did pacbio sequencing, assembly, annotations, organelle genomes and evolutionary/phylogenomic/comparative genomics approaches. Additionally, during that tenure, I worked for collaborations with the host organization such as Edinburgh UK, to analyse the genomics data for PAFTOL species and the chloroplast genomes of the Ambrosia clade from Norway.
- **2016-2017:** University of Connecticut, USA, where i analyzed the Douglas fir genome from the genome annotation to the phylogenomics and identifying genes and evolution of importance.
- **2014â€“2016:** University of Technology, Sydney, Australia, where I developed computational methods for understanding seagrasses.
- **2011-2014:** Fondazione Edmund Mach, Italy, where I developed and analyzed bioinformatics methods for transcriptional and post-transcriptional genomics across nuclear and organelle genomes. I analyzed multiple metagenomics anlaysis coming from the fungal and bacterial species involving ITS metagenomics, as well as the bacterial genome metagenomics.
